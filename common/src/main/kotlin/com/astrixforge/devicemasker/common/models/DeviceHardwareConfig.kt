 * Correlated device hardware values.

 * These values represent physical hardware characteristics that must be consistent:
 * - IMEI identifies the device on GSM/LTE networks (all modern phones use this)
 * - Serial number pattern matches the manufacturer
 * - WiFi MAC may use manufacturer's OUI (first 3 bytes)
 * - Bluetooth MAC is independent (different chip)
 * 
 * Note: MEID has been removed as CDMA networks were deprecated/shut down in 2022.
 * All modern devices use IMEI only.
